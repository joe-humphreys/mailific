# Contributing to Mailific

It should hopefully be fairly straightforward to build the library and run the tests with maven.

The pom includes the Google code formatting plugin because I hate freedom. If the plugin itself becomes a problem (as opposed to the formatting it does), please file an issue on github.

I have so far maintained 100% unit test coverage by line. I understand all the arguments for why that's a bad goal and meaningless metric, but you know what? It's actually been pretty helpful to me in every project where I've tried it. So please get as much coverage as possible, and if you can't manage 100%, don't let that stop you from contributing -- I'll fill it in later.

Contributors will be asked to sign a Contributor License Agreement. I'm told this process is automatic, but I don't actually know how that works, so again, let me know via github issue if you have problems with it.
